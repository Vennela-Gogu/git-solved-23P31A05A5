## üîß Conflicts Resolved

### üîÄ Merge 1: `main` + `dev` (6 files)

#### 1. `config/app-config.yaml`
- **Issue**: Port mismatch (8080 vs 3000)
- **Resolution**: Unified config with environment-based settings
- **Difficulty**: Medium | **Time**: 15 min

#### 2. `config/database-config.json`
- **Issue**: Different DB hosts and SSL modes
- **Resolution**: Separate profiles for prod/dev
- **Difficulty**: Medium | **Time**: 10 min

#### 3. `scripts/deploy.sh`
- **Issue**: Different deployment strategies
- **Resolution**: Conditional logic via `DEPLOY_ENV`
- **Difficulty**: Hard | **Time**: 20 min

#### 4. `scripts/monitor.js`
- **Issue**: Log format and interval conflicts
- **Resolution**: Config object based on `NODE_ENV`
- **Difficulty**: Medium | **Time**: 15 min

#### 5. `docs/architecture.md`
- **Issue**: Conflicting architectural descriptions
- **Resolution**: Merged into comprehensive sections
- **Difficulty**: Easy | **Time**: 10 min

#### 6. `README.md`
- **Issue**: Feature list and version mismatch
- **Resolution**: Combined and categorized features
- **Difficulty**: Easy | **Time**: 10 min

### üîÄ Merge 2: `main` + `conflict-simulator` (Document similarly)
Conflict 1: scripts/deploy.sh
- Issue: main used production deployment logic; conflict-simulator added simulation flags and mock endpoints
- Resolution: Integrated a SIMULATE=true toggle to switch between real and mock deployments
- Strategy: Wrapped simulator logic in conditional blocks
- Difficulty: Hard
- Time: 25 minutes

Conflict 2: scripts/monitor.js
- Issue: main had real-time logging; conflict-simulator added synthetic delay and mock alerts
- Resolution: Created a mode config to switch between real and simulated monitoring
- Strategy: Used process.env.MODE to control behavior
- Difficulty: Medium
- Time: 15 minutes
Conflict 3: config/simulator-config.json
- Issue: File didn‚Äôt exist in main; added by conflict-simulator
- Resolution: Accepted entire file from simulator branch
- Strategy: Verified structure and added comments for clarity
- Difficulty: Easy
- Time: 5 minutes

Conflict 4: README.md
- Issue: main listed production features; conflict-simulator added simulation instructions
- Resolution: Merged both sections with clear headings
- Strategy: Created ‚ÄúSimulation Mode‚Äù subsection
- Difficulty: Easy
- Time: 10 minutes

Conflict 5: docs/architecture.md
- Issue: main described real system flow; conflict-simulator added mock flow diagrams
- Resolution: Combined both into a dual-mode architecture overview
- Strategy: Used tabs or sections to separate real vs simulated flows
- Difficulty: Medium
- Time: 15 minutes

Conflict 6: test/test-simulator.js
- Issue: File only existed in conflict-simulator; not present in main
- Resolution: Accepted full file and added to test suite
- Strategy: Verified compatibility with existing test runner
- Difficulty: Easy
- Time: 5 minutes

## ‚öîÔ∏è Most Challenging Parts

1. **Understanding Conflict Markers**  
   Learned how to interpret `<<<<<<<`, `=======`, `>>>>>>>` and identify which side is HEAD.

2. **Choosing What to Keep**  
   Required careful reading and understanding of both code versions.

3. **Complex Logic Conflicts**  
   Especially in `deploy.sh`, merging two strategies into one.

4. **Testing After Resolution**  
   Ensured merged code worked as expected before committing.

## üìö Key Learnings

### üß† Technical Skills
- Mastered conflict resolution
- Understood merge vs rebase
- Practiced cherry-pick, reset, and reflog recovery

### ‚úÖ Best Practices
- Always read both sides of a conflict
- Test before committing
- Use atomic commits
- Write clear commit messages

### üîÑ Git Workflow Insights
- Conflicts are part of collaboration
- Reflog is a recovery lifesaver
- Documentation helps future debugging

## üí¨ Reflection
This challenge transformed my understanding of Git. Conflicts aren‚Äôt errors ‚Äî they‚Äôre decisions. I now feel confident resolving them in real-world projects. The hands-on practice with advanced commands like `rebase`, `reset`, and `reflog` gave me the confidence to treat Git as a powerful tool, not just a version tracker.
